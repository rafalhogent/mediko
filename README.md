**HoGent graduation thesis:**
### Cross-platform application with Vue, Quasar and NestJs

This thesis aims to answer the question of whether a software development method based on using single source code in JavaScript/TypeScript and publication across multiple platforms can produce a reliable working application. This method could be very useful for developers whose code can also be published as standalone applications. The technologies used will include: Quasar, Vue, NestJS, Electron and Cordova.

## Client application
